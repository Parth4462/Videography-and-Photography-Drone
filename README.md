# Videography-and-Photography-Drone

This repository contains code, scripts, and documentation related to a drone photography and videography project. The project aims to utilize a drone for capturing high-quality aerial images and videos for various applications, such as real estate, landscape photography, event coverage, and inspections.

## Project Goals

* **Automated Flight and Capture:** Develop scripts for automated flight paths and image/video capture based on predefined parameters.
* **Image/Video Processing:** Implement post-processing workflows for enhancing captured media, including color correction, stabilization, and stitching (for panoramas).
* **Data Management:** Organize and manage captured data efficiently, including metadata tagging and storage.
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement a system for real-time monitoring of drone telemetry and camera feed.
* **Integration with Mapping Services:** Explore integration with mapping services (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox) for geotagging and visualizing captured data.

  ## Hardware

* **Drone:** (Specify the drone model, e.g., DJI Mavic 3, Autel EVO II Pro)
    * Camera specifications (resolution, sensor size, lens)
    * Flight control system details
* **Remote Controller:** (Specify the remote controller model)
* **Computer:** (Specify the computer specifications used for processing)
* **Optional:** (Specify any additional hardware, e.g., filters, external storage)

## Software

* **Python:** (Specify the Python version)
* **Drone SDK:** (Specify the drone SDK used, e.g., DJI OSDK, DroneKit)
* **Image Processing Libraries:** (e.g., OpenCV, Pillow)
* **Video Processing Libraries:** (e.g., FFmpeg, MoviePy)
* **Mapping Libraries:** (e.g., Folium, GDAL)
* **Operating System:** (Specify the operating system)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Drone SDK:**

    * Follow the instructions provided by the drone manufacturer to install and configure the SDK.
    * Ensure the drone is properly connected to the computer or remote controller.

4.  **Hardware Setup:**

    * Assemble the drone and connect the required peripherals.
    * Calibrate the drone according to the manufacturer's instructions.

## Usage

* **Flight Control:**
    * Run the scripts in the `scripts/flight_control/` directory to automate flight paths and capture sequences.
    * Modify the scripts to customize flight parameters (e.g., altitude, speed, capture intervals).
* **Image/Video Processing:**
    * Use the scripts in the `scripts/image_processing/` and `scripts/video_processing/` directories to enhance captured media.
    * Adjust processing parameters to achieve desired results.
* **Data Management:**
    * Utilize the scripts in the `scripts/data_management/` directory to organize and manage captured data.
    * Add metadata tags to images and videos for easy retrieval and organization.
* **Mapping Integration:**
    * Explore the mapping integration scripts to display geo tagged images and videos.
